# CCLE Template

## Task

Redesign the CCLE front page in your style, but keep some elements intact.
Read the [UCLA brand guidelines](http://brand.ucla.edu/brand/overview/) and interpret it as you see fit in your design.

This template has been built up with [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) so that you can have create a live working demo of your design (with full html/css/js).  Foundation sets up the basic styles and typography for you.  Feel free to use any of the components/controls/navigation it provides for you.  Make good use of the responsive grid so that your design is mobile friendly.

Look into the [Foundation docs](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/) for reference.

Feel free to go beyond Foundation if you need to do so.  Feel free to use any other framework or library (like jQuery).

## Installation

This project has been set up for you to get started quickly.  To install and run do:

```bash
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ npm start
```

If all that works, you should be able to edit anything under the `src` directory and it will automatically refresh the browser for you.

If something went wrong, you most likely need to install Node, see:
